# Scale-Variance Web App

This web application demonstrates the effect of scale on quality metrics for dimensionality reduction algorithms. It visualizes how normalized stress and KL divergence varies with the scale of the projection (generated by DR algorithms) across various datasets and dimensionality reduction techniques.

## Running Locally

Follow the following steps to launch the application on your own device:

### Setup and Installation

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Application

To start the application, run:
```bash
streamlit run Home.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open your default web browser to the application.
